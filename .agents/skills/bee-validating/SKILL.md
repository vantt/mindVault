# Validating — Guard Bees

Validating is the hard gate between planning and execution. It rejects beautiful fantasy plans by demanding repo/system evidence, feasibility proof, and cells a stranger could pick up cold. Never skip validating — it scales down, it does not disappear.

**Lane scaling.** For `tiny` and `small`, this skill is **not separately invoked**: the reality check runs inline inside bee-planning before the merged shape+execution gate (see bee-planning §5), and no validating subagents are spawned. This skill's full protocol below applies from `standard` upward — `standard` runs the plan-checker and cell reviewer; `high-risk` scales the checker to a persona panel. A `spike` runs whatever single proof its question demands, nothing more.

Start with `node .bee/bin/bee.mjs status --json`. If onboarding is missing or stale, stop and invoke bee-hive.

## Required Inputs

- `docs/history/<feature>/CONTEXT.md`
- `docs/history/<feature>/plan.md` — approved and **frozen at Gate 2** (D1): its content sections are immutable once `approved_gates.shape` is set, so what validating reads is byte-identical to what the human approved
- the discovery and approach content: `docs/history/<feature>/discovery.md` and `approach.md` **if they exist**; otherwise the `## Discovery` and `## Approach` sections folded into `plan.md` (decision 0009 — separate files are written only for L2+ discovery or high-risk lanes)
- current-slice cells exist: `node .bee/bin/bee.mjs cells list --feature <feature>` (D2 — the current slice lives only in cells; there is no separate slice document)

If `plan.md` is absent, unapproved, or the current-slice cells do not exist, stop and return to bee-planning. Never validate an unapproved shape. A missing `discovery.md`/`approach.md` is **not** a failure when `plan.md` carries the equivalent sections — read those instead; stop only if neither the files nor the sections exist and the plan genuinely lacks discovery/approach content.

## Operating Contract

1. **Orient** on state, mode/lane, the approved shape, and the current-work cells. The orient read (CONTEXT.md, plan.md, discovery/approach, cells) delegates as an extraction-tier I/O worker per the Delegation contract (D2/D3, `bee-hive/references/routing-and-contracts.md`) when the D2 rubric fires; judgment (mode fit, reality-gate scoring) stays on the session model.
2. **Reality gate:** MODE FIT / REPO FIT / ASSUMPTIONS / SMALLER PATH / PROOF SURFACE — each scored PASS|FAIL with file/command evidence. Fail on nonexistent code paths, unsupported commands, stale versions, missing credentials, hidden architecture work, or excess ceremony. A failed reality gate halts the pipeline and returns to bee-planning.
3. **Feasibility matrix:** every blocking assumption gets a row — assumption | risk | proof required | evidence | result. Accepted evidence only (below). Plausibility language is an automatic NOT READY. For multi-cell slices, the matrix includes a schedule row: `bee cells schedule` reports zero cycles and the expected wave shape — required evidence, not optional.
4. **Spikes** for unproven assumptions that can invalidate the current work.
5. **Plan-checker subagent** (adversarial) until structurally clean or escalated.
6. **Cold-pickup cell review**; fix every CRITICAL flag.
7. **Decide** using the decision vocabulary, then ask Gate 3.

Load `references/validation-reference.md` for report formats, repair routing, and the subagent prompts.

## Accepted Evidence

Existing implementation, file/API/type inspection, command output, build/typecheck/test result, official version/doc proof, runtime probe, or a `.bee/spikes/<feature>/` result. Evidence that is only "should work", "likely", "expected", or model knowledge → **NOT READY**.

## Spike Rules

- One spike answers exactly one yes/no question.
- Disposable code lives under `.bee/spikes/<feature>/`.
- **NO** → return to bee-planning with the failed assumption and the required plan change.
- **YES** → record the discovered constraints for planning and execution.
- Spike code never silently becomes production code.

**Verify scripts and any executable code NEVER go in `docs/history/`** (GitHub #17). `docs/history/` is the tech-agnostic knowledge layer — `.md` only (CONTEXT.md, plan.md, reports, walkthrough). A cell's `verify` is a runnable command; when it needs a multi-line harness, that script lives in **the project's own scripts** (committed with the product, so `verify` points at it) or, if disposable, in **`.bee/spikes/<feature>/`**. The write-guard denies a code-extension file (`.sh`, `.mjs`, `.py`, …) written under `docs/history/`.

## Plan Checker (adversarial)

Dispatch a subagent on the **`review` slot** (decision 0021 — `resolveTier(root, 'review', runtime)`, default opus on Claude, generation fallback; state the model explicitly; if the runtime cannot select per-agent models, cap its reads and output instead).
Codex has no per-agent subagent type (AO11), so the tier stays enforced as a read budget + output cap only.
The plan-checker is a **read-only gather**, never a cell — when the review slot is cli-shaped, resolve it with the purpose-scoped 4-arg form, `resolveTier(root, 'review', runtime, {for:'gather'})`, per the Delegation contract's cli gather branch (`bee-hive/references/routing-and-contracts.md`); a bare 3-arg resolve of a cli-shaped review slot now refuses (AO12/B1, plan 2A-ii). A model-shaped review slot is unaffected by purpose — dispatch it exactly as before — **in the background where the runtime supports it** (decision 0017): continue the spike/matrix/cell-review work while it runs; its findings block nothing until the Gate 3 presentation, which never happens with the checker still outstanding. It assumes the plan is flawed and verifies 5 dimensions: requirement/decision coverage, cell completeness, dependency correctness, key links, scope sanity. Every finding carries **BLOCKER** or **WARNING**. Maximum 3 structural-verification iterations; a BLOCKER still open after iteration 3 escalates to the user. Never attempt iteration 4.

**High-risk lane:** scale to a persona panel — coherence + feasibility lenses always, plus conditional lenses (security, product, scope-guardian) chosen by the diff of concerns. Dedupe findings, then synthesize into auto-fix vs present-for-decision buckets.

## Cell Review (cold pickup)

Dispatch the cell reviewer (`review` slot, decision 0021).
Could a worker with no session history pick each cell up cold? **CRITICAL** flags — assumed context, vague acceptance, scope overload, unproven feasibility, broken verify — must be fixed before approval. **MINOR** flags may ship with a recorded note.

## Decision Vocabulary

```text
READY
READY WITH CONSTRAINTS
NOT READY - RUN SPIKE
NOT READY - RETURN TO PLANNING
```

READY is a feasibility verdict, not execution approval — Gate 3 still requires the user.

## Gate 3 — Execution Approval

**Advisor consult (AO2b/AO3/AO4) — runs before this gate opens, at every bypass level.** For a high-risk or hard-gate slice, the orchestrator consults the configured advisor **before** presenting Gate 3 to the human, and before self-approving it under any bypass level (`normal`/`full`/`total` lift the *human* checkpoint below — they never lift this mechanical precondition). Resolve the advisor from config (`resolveAdvisor(root, runtime)`):
- **cli-shaped** advisor → run the configured command verbatim, read-only, with an evidence bundle on stdin (plan summary, risk map, validation findings, open questions — never session history, never secrets) and capture the digest.
- **model-shaped** advisor → dispatch a `bee-review`-class read-only run with the same evidence bundle.
- **unconfigured** advisor (`resolveAdvisor` returns `null`) → record that fact and proceed. AO2(b) adds one trigger; it is not a hard dependency on an advisor being configured.

Then record the consult: `node .bee/bin/bee.mjs state advisor-ref record --advisor "<identity>" --digest-file <path>` (the verb stamps the staleness anchors itself — the caller supplies only the advisor identity and the digest file).

**Enforcement is a throw, not a warning.** For high-risk work, `node .bee/bin/bee.mjs state gate --name execution --approved true` refuses — throws, never just warns — when the selected record's `advisor_ref` is missing or stale (AO3/AO13). Nothing is written until a non-stale `advisor_ref` exists; this is CLI-enforced, not optional ceremony. An `advisor_ref` is stale if **any** of (AO13, verbatim):
1. its feature differs from `state.feature`;
2. the newest active decision id changed since the consult;
3. `sha256(plan.md)` changed since the consult;
4. the ref predates the most recent revocation of the execution gate.

Never a time-based TTL — AO13 already burned this feature on one invented number once.

**Advice never approves a gate and never overrides a locked decision.** The consult's digest is data for the human decision, not a decision itself (critical rule 13, existing law); an advisor result that conflicts with a locked `CONTEXT.md` decision is surfaced to the human, never silently followed or used to auto-approve.

Write the full machine report (reality gate, matrix, plan-checker findings, cell review, approval block) to `docs/history/<feature>/reports/validation-<slice>.md`. For `small`/`standard`/`high-risk`, invoke `bee-briefing` in refresh mode to patch the implement plan's Validation Plan section with the accepted evidence links (and to flip its `status` if a source changed), so the Gate 3 message links a current brief. Then present **only the human layer** in chat per the Gate Presentation Contract (template in the reference): what I'm about to do / why it's trustworthy / if it goes wrong / what you are deciding — in the user's language, jargon-free, implement plan + report linked — then ask verbatim: **"Feasibility validated. Approve execution?"** Optionally offer a cross-model second opinion first (agreement → mention it; disagreement → quote both positions; never auto-resolve). Approval covers the **current work only**; future slices return to planning and validating.

On approval, update state: `node .bee/bin/bee.mjs state gate --name execution --approved true` then `node .bee/bin/bee.mjs state set --owner validating --phase swarming --summary "<summary>" --next-action "Invoke bee-swarming for the validated work."` (`validated` is not a phase — it never was; the approved execution gate is what records that. See chain-integrity D6.)

**Gate bypass (opt-in, decisions 0010/dcf01d7b) — LEVEL-AWARE.** Read the active level first (`node .bee/bin/bee.mjs status --json` → `gate_bypass_level`), then apply the routing contract's level table (`routing-and-contracts.md §Gate bypass`):
- `off` → present Gate 3 to the human as above.
- `normal` → if the lane is `tiny`/`small`/`standard` with no hard-gate flag, do not ask (self-approve, below); a `high-risk` lane or any hard-gate flag (auth, authorization, data loss, audit/security, external provider, validation removal, migration/schema) STILL stops for the human under `normal`.
- `full` / `total` → the human deliberately **lifted the high-risk/hard-gate floor** by choosing the level; do NOT re-erect it — auto-approve Gate 3 at **every** lane, high-risk and hard-gate included.

When the level covers this gate: do not ask — take the recommendation, set `approved_gates.execution: true` yourself (`bee.mjs state gate --name execution --approved true`), still write the machine-layer report, log a one-line audit decision, post a short `⚡ auto-approved Gate 3 (bypass)` line, and hand off to bee-swarming. (`total` only stops for secret-file reads; those are not a gate. Gate 4 UAT/P1 is separate and follows §Gate 4.)

## Headless

With `mode:headless`: run every check, apply unambiguous cell repairs, and defer ambiguous ones to an `Outstanding Questions` section of the structured terminal report. Headless **stops at the Gate 3 question** — it emits the approval block and the READY/NOT READY verdict and exits. It never self-approves execution.

## Red Flags

- skipping the reality gate or feasibility matrix
- spawning the plan-checker or cell reviewer for a tiny/small lane (their reality check lives inline in planning)
- accepting plausibility language as evidence
- continuing after a NO spike because a workaround "probably works"
- running a 4th plan-checker iteration instead of escalating
- approving (or letting approval cover) future slices
- CRITICAL cell flags left unfixed at approval time
- a tiny fix wearing epic ceremony; a hard-gate change routed below high-risk
- self-approving Gate 3, in any mode
- presenting or auto-approving Gate 3 for high-risk/hard-gate work without first running the advisor consult and recording a non-stale `advisor_ref` (AO2b/AO3/AO13)
- treating an advisor digest as a decision instead of data, or letting it silently override a locked `CONTEXT.md` decision

Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.

Validation complete and Gate 3 approved. Invoke bee-swarming skill.
