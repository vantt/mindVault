# Validation Reference

Load after bee-validating is selected and the required inputs exist. Formats here are normative — reports must use them.

## Protocol

1. Orient: `node .bee/bin/bee.mjs status --json`, mode/lane, approved `plan.md`, current cells.
2. Reality gate report (below), evidence attached.
3. Feasibility matrix for every blocking assumption.
4. Spike/probe any unproven assumption that can invalidate the current work.
5. Plan-checker subagent, max 3 iterations.
6. Cell review (cold pickup); fix CRITICAL flags.
7. Decision, then the Gate 3 approval block.

## Reality Gate Report

```text
REALITY GATE REPORT
Mode: <tiny|spike|small|standard|high-risk>
Current work: <one sentence>
MODE FIT: PASS|FAIL       — lane matches the mechanical risk flags; least honest workflow
REPO FIT: PASS|FAIL       — named files/APIs/commands exist in this repo today
ASSUMPTIONS: PASS|FAIL    — every blocking assumption is listed in the matrix
SMALLER PATH: PASS|FAIL   — no smaller path delivers the locked decisions
PROOF SURFACE: PASS|FAIL  — every cell's verify command runs in this repo
Decision: proceed | revise planning | run spike first | collapse mode
Evidence: <file paths / command output / runtime evidence per line above>
```

Fail on: nonexistent code paths, unsupported commands, stale versions, missing credentials, unreachable services, hidden architecture work, or excess ceremony.

## Feasibility Matrix

Required whenever blocking assumptions remain; always for the high-risk lane.

```text
FEASIBILITY MATRIX
Assumption | Risk | Proof Required | Evidence | Result
```

Accepted evidence: existing implementation, file/API/type inspection, command output, build/typecheck/test result, official version/doc proof, runtime/API probe, or `.bee/spikes/<feature>/` proof. "Should work", "likely", "expected", or model knowledge → the row (and the matrix) is **NOT READY**.

## Spike / Probe Rules

- One spike = one yes/no question.
- Disposable proof lives under `.bee/spikes/<feature>/`.
- NO → return to bee-planning with the failed assumption and the plan change it forces.
- YES → record constraints for planning and execution.
- Spike code must never silently become production implementation.

## Repair Routing

| Finding | Route |
|---|---|
| False assumption / wrong mode or lane | back to bee-planning |
| Locked decision uncovered by any cell | `plan.md` + new/edited cells (cite the D-ID) |
| Cell dependency, file-scope, or test gap | edit the cell (`node .bee/bin/bee.mjs cells show --id <id>` first) |
| Broken or unrunnable verify command | fix the cell's `verify`; re-run PROOF SURFACE |
| Unreachable exit / integration hole | `plan.md` (key links) then cells |
| Scope reduction of a locked decision | prohibited — SPLIT the work instead, via planning |

## Plan-Checker Subagent Prompt

Dispatch at the **generation** tier; name the model explicitly (fallback: read budget + output cap). Verify, do not redesign.

```text
You are an adversarial plan checker. Assume the plan is flawed until proven otherwise.
Inputs: docs/history/<feature>/CONTEXT.md, approach.md, plan.md, and the current-work cells
(node .bee/bin/bee.mjs cells list --feature <feature>).
Verify exactly 5 dimensions:
1. Requirement/decision coverage — every locked D-ID lands in at least one cell.
2. Cell completeness — each cell has files, read_first, directive action, must_haves
   (per lane tier), and a runnable verify.
3. Dependency correctness — deps form a DAG; no cell depends on a future slice.
4. Key links — integration points named in plan.md are owned by a specific cell.
5. Scope sanity — no cell is doing hidden architecture work or exceeds its lane.
Report every finding as BLOCKER (structurally unsound) or WARNING (survivable, note it).
Do not propose redesigns. Do not soften findings. Quote file/cell evidence per finding.
```

Max 3 structural iterations (check → repair → re-check). An open BLOCKER after iteration 3 escalates to the user with both positions. Never run iteration 4.

### High-Risk Persona Panel

For the high-risk lane, replace the single checker with a small panel: **coherence** and **feasibility** personas always; add conditional lenses — **security**, **product**, **scope-guardian** — chosen by the diff of concerns (auth/data → security; user-visible behavior → product; growing surface → scope-guardian). Each persona gets the same inputs and the BLOCKER/WARNING vocabulary. Dedupe overlapping findings, then synthesize into two buckets: **auto-fix** (apply, record) and **present-for-decision** (user judgment required).

## Cell-Reviewer Subagent Prompt

Dispatch at the **generation** tier. Stress-test whether each cell can be picked up cold.

```text
You are a fresh-eyes cell reviewer with NO session history. For each current-work cell
(node .bee/bin/bee.mjs cells show --id <id>), answer: could a worker who has read only
CONTEXT.md, plan.md, and this cell implement and verify it without guessing?
Flag CRITICAL: assumed context, vague acceptance, scope overload, unproven feasibility,
broken verify command.
Flag MINOR: missing rationale, implicit file assumption, fuzzy boundary, known tradeoff
not recorded.
```

```text
CELL REVIEW REPORT
Work: <current slice / direct task>
Cells reviewed: <N>
CRITICAL FLAGS: <cell-id> problem / evidence / fix
MINOR FLAGS: <cell-id> problem / evidence / suggestion
CLEAN CELLS: <cell-id>, <cell-id>
REVISIONS MADE: <cell-id> change / why
SUMMARY: <2-3 sentences>
```

All CRITICAL flags must be fixed before Gate 3. MINOR flags ship with a recorded note.

## Approval Gate Block

Two layers (Gate Presentation Contract, bee-hive routing reference). The machine block goes into the **report file** `docs/history/<feature>/reports/validation-<slice>.md`, together with the reality gate report, feasibility matrix, plan-checker findings, and cell review above. It is never pasted into chat:

```text
VALIDATION COMPLETE - APPROVAL REQUIRED BEFORE EXECUTION
Mode: <mode>
Work: <current slice / direct task / spike>
Reality gate: PASS
Feasibility: READY | READY WITH CONSTRAINTS
Structure: PASS after <N> iterations
Spikes: <none | passed | constraints recorded>
Cell review: PASS (<N> cells, 0 CRITICAL open)
Unresolved concerns: <none | list>
```

The **chat message** is the human layer only — in the user's language, jargon-free:

```text
What I'm about to do: [the change in the user's terms, one sentence — what changes for them, not the mechanism].
Why it's trustworthy: [the single strongest piece of evidence, plain words — e.g. "a dry run rebuilt all 3 pages byte-for-byte identical"].
If it goes wrong: [what breaks for the user + how we'd notice — loud failure, rollback path].
You are deciding: whether I may start editing real files — this slice of work only.
Full validation report: docs/history/<feature>/reports/validation-<slice>.md
Feasibility validated. Approve execution?
```

Litmus: the user can restate what they are approving in their own words.

Approval is for the current work only. On yes: update `.bee/state.json` (`approved_gates.execution: true`) and hand off to bee-swarming. In headless mode, stop here — emit both layers in the terminal report and exit without approval.

## Red Flags

- skipping reality or feasibility gates because everything "looks right"
- plausibility accepted as proof under time pressure
- continuing after a NO spike
- iteration 4 of the plan checker
- cells not tied to the current work slice
- a small fix generating epic ceremony; a hard-gate change validated as small
- Gate 3 asked with CRITICAL cell flags still open
- the machine block pasted into chat, or a gate message the user cannot restate in their own words
