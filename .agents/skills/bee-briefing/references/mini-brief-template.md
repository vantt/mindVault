# Mini-Brief Template (`small` lane)

Load when `bee-briefing` renders a `small`-lane feature. The full template is overkill here; the mini-brief is the ~15-line record a human can review at Gate 2 without opening `plan.md`. Same projection rules as the full template (SKILL.md §1/§3): render from the truth artifacts, author only the one-line Risk/Rollback, never invent, never claim un-run validation.

Path: `docs/history/<feature>/implement-plan.md` (same file, smaller body).

# Implementation Plan: <Feature>

**Goal** — <the user outcome in one sentence; cite D-IDs>

**In scope** — <what changes>
**Out of scope** — <what does not>

**Affected files**
- `<path>` — <why>

**Validation** — `<verify command>` → expected: <outcome>. Evidence: <link once validating runs; "pending" before>

**Risk** — <one line, or "none">
**Rollback** — <one line: revert the cell's commit / disable the flag>

**Open questions** — <or "none — ready for review">
```

Rules:

- If a line has no real content, delete it — do not write "N/A". (Same drop-empty discipline as the full template.)
- If the work grows past `small` during planning, the lane changes upstream in `plan.md` first; then re-render as the full template. Never stretch the mini-brief to carry `standard` work.
- Everything but Risk and Rollback is projected from the truth artifacts. Those two one-liners are the only authored content; an undecided rollback is "OPEN QUESTION", not a plausible guess.
