name: bee-xia
description: >-
  Evidence-labeled research scout for unfamiliar, ambiguous, or version-sensitive territory. Use when the user asks to research a topic, library, or approach with no feature underway; when planning discovery lands on L2/L3; or before high-risk work where the repo has no precedent. Not for locking product decisions, proving feasibility, or writing code.
metadata:
  version: '0.1'
  ecosystem: bee
  dependencies:
    web-docs-search:
      kind: capability
      missing_effect: degraded
      reason: Checks current official documentation version-aware (Exa or WebSearch/WebFetch/browser); absent, docs claims degrade to Inference and become proof obligations for validating.
    upstream-pattern-research:
      kind: capability
      missing_effect: degraded
      reason: Inspects public repositories for proven patterns (DeepWiki or direct repo reading); absent, the upstream step degrades to direct public-repo reading, never silently skipped.

# xia (forager bees)

Forager bees range beyond the hive and return with a map, not honey. xia is the anti-reinvention scout: it answers *what exists, what can be reused, what the docs actually say, and what is the lightest credible path* — before anything is planned or built. The cheapest correct code is the code you did not write.

If `.bee/onboarding.json` is missing or stale, stop and invoke `bee-hive`.

## Hard Gates

- **Research only.** No source edits, no cells, no architecture commitments. The output is a brief, never code.
- **Locked decisions win.** A finding that contradicts an active D-ID is *noted* with its evidence; superseding the D-ID is the user's move, never xia's.
- **Finish the brief before recommending.** Ask one targeted question only when viable paths differ materially in behavior, operational risk, or migration cost — otherwise recommend from evidence.
- xia is already the delegated researcher (per the Delegation contract, D2/D3, `bee-hive/references/routing-and-contracts.md`); its internal step 1 stack-ledger scan may sub-delegate as an extraction-tier I/O worker. Any other ad-hoc subagent dispatch xia makes beyond its own research steps defaults to the generation slot model; ceiling requires the [bee-tier: ceiling] marker plus a one-line justification.

## Depth

`Quick` / `Standard` / `Deep` — mirroring planning's L1/L2/L3. Quick: one API/version/behavior confirmed. Standard (default): the full four-step flow. Deep: cross-cutting, version-sensitive, or architecture-heavy territory. If unsure, Standard.

## Flow — Order Is the Protocol

Web research before local evidence is a red flag, not a shortcut. Full step rules in `references/xia-protocol.md`.

1. **Stack ledger** — classify the repo and map languages, frameworks, and *installed versions* from real artifacts (manifests, lockfiles, configs, tests). Never from folder names, branding, or memory.
2. **Local reuse** — search feature-adjacent code, tests, scripts, config, docs. Must answer: what exists, what is reusable, which extension points are available, what is genuinely missing. "Missing" requires code, config, docs, *and* tests checked.
3. **Upstream patterns** — only after local evidence is clear. Framework repo, library repo, official starters, close integrations: reusable proof, not inspiration.
4. **Current official docs** — version-matched to the repo. When local behavior and docs disagree, local behavior is current truth; record the mismatch.

## Evidence Labels

Every non-trivial claim carries one — never blurred:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Local` | proven from this repository's files or command output |
| `Upstream` | observed in a public repository or official starter |
| `Docs` | stated by official, version-matched documentation |
| `Inference` | concluded from the above; not directly observed |

## Recommendation Ladder

Lightest credible path, in order; each skipped rung needs a stated reason:

1. **Reuse** existing local functionality.
2. **Built-in** framework/library capability at the repo's installed version.
3. **Adapt** a proven upstream pattern that fits the repo.
4. **Build** from scratch — only with rungs 1–3 rejected for stated reasons.

State why the chosen rung beats the next-best alternative, and what evidence would change the recommendation.

## Output

- **In-chain** (invoked from `bee-planning` discovery L2/L3): no separate file — findings merge into the feature's `approach.md` (chosen path / rejected alternatives carry the ladder rationale; risk-map rows cite evidence labels; version caveats and `Inference`-only claims become open questions for `bee-validating`).
- **Standalone** (no feature underway): write `docs/history/research/<topic-slug>.md` from `references/research-brief-template.md`, lead with the Bottom Line, and suggest the next step — `bee-exploring` if the topic is becoming a fuzzy feature, `bee-planning` if scope is already clear.
- A genuinely new first-principles finding (layer-3 knowledge) → flag it for `bee-compounding`.

## Headless

`mode:headless`: run all four steps without questions; every would-be question becomes an `Outstanding Questions` entry in the brief. Recommendations are still made — labeled with confidence — never deferred wholesale.

## Red Flags

- stack guessed from folder names, branding, or memory
- web research before local evidence
- "missing" claimed without checking code, config, docs, and tests
- stale or version-mismatched docs used without saying so
- `Local` / `Upstream` / `Docs` / `Inference` collapsed into one narrative
- a recommendation without the rejected rungs stated
- a capability gap silently skipping a step instead of degrading it honestly
- a research finding silently replacing a locked D-ID
- writing code "just to try it" mid-research (that is a spike — `bee-validating` owns it)

Violating the letter of these rules is violating the spirit of these rules.

## Handoff

In-chain: findings merged into `approach.md`. Return to bee-planning.
Standalone: brief written to `docs/history/research/<topic-slug>.md`. Suggest bee-exploring or bee-planning as the next step; the user chooses.
