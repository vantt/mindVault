# Worker Details

Open this when the compact worker loop needs exact fields or commands.

## Parent Context

The orchestrator supplies: agent nickname (reservation identity), assigned cell id, feature name, paths to `CONTEXT.md` and `plan.md`, global constraints, model tier, and the status-token protocol. Nothing else arrives — if the cell is not executable from that plus the repo, return `[BLOCKED]`; do not guess.

## Expanded Commands

```text
node .bee/bin/bee.mjs status --json
node .bee/bin/bee.mjs cells show --id <id>
node .bee/bin/bee.mjs cells claim --id <id> --worker "<name>"
node .bee/bin/bee.mjs reservations reserve --agent "<name>" --cell "<id>" --path "<path>" --ttl 3600
node .bee/bin/bee.mjs cells verify --id <id> --command "<cmd>" --passed true|false [--output-file <f>]
node .bee/bin/bee.mjs cells cap --id <id> [--outcome TEXT] [--files a,b] [--behavior-change] [--evidence-stdin] [--deviations-file F] [--friction TEXT]
node .bee/bin/bee.mjs reservations release --agent "<name>" --cell "<id>"
node .bee/bin/bee.mjs decisions active --recent 3
```

Shell guard for write-heavy commands (`git add/mv/rm`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `sed -i`, `tee`, redirection writes):

```bash
BEE_AGENT_NAME="<name>" git add src/foo.ts
```

## Assigned Cell Check

For the one assigned cell, confirm before claiming:

- status is `open` and all `deps` are capped
- `files` scope is clear and reservable
- the `verify` command is concrete and runnable in this repo
- referenced decision IDs resolve in `CONTEXT.md` and do not contradict the action

`[NOOP]` if the cell is missing or already done; `[BLOCKED]` for ambiguity or a locked-decision conflict.

## Trace Field Tiers By Lane

| Lane | Required trace on cap |
|---|---|
| `tiny` | one-line `outcome` |
| `small` | `outcome`, `files_changed` |
| `standard` | `outcome`, `files_changed`, `deviations`, `friction` when a trigger fired |
| `high-risk` | all of the above (non-empty `files_changed` and `outcome` are enforced by the helper), plus spike-evidence links where the plan recorded constraints, plus `verification_evidence` |
| any lane with `behavior_change: true` | `verification_evidence` is mandatory — `cap` refuses without it; pipe it via `--evidence-stdin` (no file written) |

## Friction Triggers (verbatim — record friction only when one fires)

- had to infer a missing rule
- validation unclear/too expensive
- stale or contradictory doc
- repeated manual step that should be a template
- out-of-scope but important
- unattributable failure

One line per trigger, factual, in `--friction` (or the deviations file for multiples). No trigger fired → leave friction empty; do not invent process commentary.

## verification_evidence Example

Piped via `--evidence-stdin` on cap for any `behavior_change: true` cell (the evidence goes straight into `trace.verification_evidence` — **no file is written**):

```bash
node .bee/bin/bee.mjs cells cap --id <id> --files a,b --behavior-change --evidence-stdin <<'JSON'
{ ...the evidence object below... }
JSON
```

The evidence object:

```json
{
  "tests_inspected": ["tests/auth/middleware.test.ts"],
  "tests_added_or_changed": ["tests/auth/session-timeout.test.ts (new, 3 cases)"],
  "red_failure_evidence": "session-timeout.test.ts failed before the change: expected 401, received 200",
  "verification_run": "npm test -- auth -> 42 passed, 0 failed",
  "deliberate_exceptions": []
}
```

Every field is honest or explicitly empty with a reason in `deliberate_exceptions`. Vague evidence here becomes a P1 finding in bee-reviewing — the work comes back.

**`red_failure_evidence` is captured at cap time, not backfilled later (decision 0009).** For a `behavior_change` cell the helper *refuses to cap* unless the evidence names a "before": the prior behavior this change alters — a `git show <pre-change-commit>:<file>` extract, or a pre-change check that failed. If the surface is genuinely new (no prior behavior to characterize), say so in `deliberate_exceptions`. This is why the characterization is cheap to record now — the old state is one `git show` away while you hold the diff in context; recovering it after review means a whole extra evidence-only cell.

## Evidence lives in one place (decision 0009)

The cell **trace** is the single source of verification evidence: `trace.verification_evidence` (the JSON above) plus `trace.verify_output` (the recorded verify run). **Pipe evidence with `--evidence-stdin` so no evidence file is ever written.** Do NOT create `reports/<cell-id>-evidence.json`, `reports/execution-*-evidence.md`, or any other on-disk evidence file — that is the exact duplication decision 0009 removed. (`--evidence-file` still exists only for back-compat; if you must use it, write to a throwaway path outside `docs/history/`, pass it to cap, and delete it — never leave it in `reports/`.) The per-cell report (below) *links and summarizes* the trace in one line; it never re-embeds it.

## Verification Failure

Fix the root cause and rerun the exact failing command. After two serious attempts, return `[BLOCKED]` with: the command, the failure summary, attempts made, your diagnosis, and the smallest useful next decision for the parent. A verify command that is itself broken in the repo is a `[BLOCKED]`, never a reason to cap with a substitute check.

## Atomic Commit

One commit per cell, cell id in the message:

```bash
BEE_AGENT_NAME="<name>" git add <files>
git commit -m "feat(<cell-id>): <summary matching the cap outcome>"
```

## Result Field Spec

Every result starts with exactly one token and includes, minimum: nickname, cell id, files touched/requested, reservation outcome (released yes/no), verification result, and the parent's next action. Mirror the result into `docs/history/<feature>/reports/<cell-id>.md` as a short summary that **links** the cell (`.bee/cells/<cell-id>.json`) for the full trace and evidence — never a second copy of the `verification_evidence` JSON or the verify output (decision 0009: the trace is the single source).

When dispatched with native worktree isolation, also report the observed working
directory, symbolic ref (or detached state), and resulting commit. These values
are informational and never authoritative: the worker does not choose or attest
its integration identity. The orchestrator must derive and recheck identity from
its protected pre-dispatch attestation and fresh Git metadata, then independently
prove base ancestry and the reserved-path diff subset before the result counts.
Do not describe a branch name, worktree id, base, or commit as integration
authority, and do not ask the orchestrator to trust a worker-supplied value.

- `[DONE]` — cell capped, one commit made, verification recorded as passed, reservations released.
- `[BLOCKED]` — cannot continue safely; include the blocker, diagnosis, and current reservation state.
- `[HANDOFF]` — `.bee/HANDOFF.json` written; include progress, active reservations, and the resume point.
- `[NOOP]` — the assigned cell is unavailable or unsafe; include why and a suggested parent action.

Ambiguities you deferred go in an `Outstanding Questions` section of the report.

## Post-Compaction Recovery

Reread, in order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/history/<feature>/CONTEXT.md`
3. `node .bee/bin/bee.mjs cells show --id <id>`
4. `node .bee/bin/bee.mjs reservations list --active-only`
