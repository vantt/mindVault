# Swarming Reference

Load after Gate 3 approval, before spawning the first wave.

## Protocol

1. Confirm gates and state: `node .bee/bin/bee.mjs status --json`
2. Sweep reservations: `node .bee/bin/bee.mjs reservations sweep`
3. Compute waves: `node .bee/bin/bee.mjs cells ready` + each cell's `deps` and `files` (overlapping files → separate waves or re-scoped cells).
4. Assign one cell per worker, build each prompt from the template below, pick and state the model tier.
5. Record workers in `.bee/state.json`, spawn the wave, tend, repeat.


## Runtime Spawn Mechanics (side by side)

| | Codex |
|---|---|
| Spawn | `spawn_agent({task_name: "<stable-name>", message: "<WORKER_PROMPT>", fork_turns: "none"})` (ORCH-01) |
| Model tier | `config.models.codex[tier]` if set; today Codex cannot select a per-agent model → tier is enforced as a read budget + output cap in the prompt |
| Result collection | Status tokens arrive in the parent thread; use `wait_agent(..., timeout_ms=60000)` only when a specific result is needed |
| Follow-up / rescue | `followup_task({target: "<agent id or task name>", message: "..."})` to continue the same agent; a fresh `spawn_agent` only for a genuinely new task — no routine `send_input(...)` mid-flight |
| Harness assist | None — the tend loop in this skill is the nudge |
| Isolation guarantee | `fork_turns: "none"`; never fork the parent history for routine cells (ORCH-02) |
| Subagent type (W3, AO5/AO10/AO11) | No per-agent subagent type — the tier is enforced as a read budget + output cap in the worker prompt regardless of what is spawned (documented asymmetry, not parity) |

On both runtimes the integrity rails are identical because they live in the helpers: `bee.mjs cells cap` refuses without a verify pass, and `bee.mjs reservations reserve` reports conflicts the worker must turn into `[BLOCKED]`.

### Native Codex timeout interval

A `wait_agent` result with no completion is an **empty wait**, not a worker
failure. Never follow an empty wait directly with `wait_agent`; authority,
urgency, and no-chatter instructions create no exception. Before a later bounded
wait, continue material task-local work when any remains; otherwise take exactly
one `list_agents` snapshot. Then send one concise commentary update naming both
the live agent state and the next action; only then may a later bounded wait run.
No-op work, repeated state reads, hidden reasoning, generic commentary, or
commentary alone do not qualify. The timeout never licenses interrupt, duplicate
dispatch, claim release, or reservation release: every running agent, claim, and
reservation stays owned. Do not poll files or scratchpads for harness-managed
native agents. External process and artifact polling stays governed by External
Executors below and is outside this native-agent rule.

## Model Tiers — Config-Driven, Runtime-Keyed (decision 0012)

Only the **cheaper** slots are configured, in `.bee/config.json` `models`, keyed by runtime first (bee is dual-runtime and each names models differently), then slot. **The ceiling is never configured** — it is always the session/orchestrator model (decision 0015). The default is the all-Claude role split (decision 0021) — session model orchestrates, opus reviews, sonnet implements, haiku extracts — and **every slot is editable to whatever models the user actually has** (only a Claude subscription → keep all-Claude; a Codex plan too → point slots at GPT via cli executors):

```json
"models": {
  "claude": { "extraction": "haiku", "generation": "sonnet", "review": "opus" },
  "codex":  { "extraction": null,    "generation": null,     "review": null }
}
```

A slot value may also be `{ "model": "opus", "effort": "xhigh" }` (P17 — per-agent reasoning effort, applied where the runtime supports it, silently recorded where it does not; levels: low/medium/high/xhigh/max) or `{ "kind": "cli", "command": "..." }` (external executor, section below — effort rides inside the command). The `review` slot is consumed by bee-reviewing's specialists, exploring's fresh-eyes, and validating's plan-checker/cell-reviewer; `null` review falls back to generation. **Copy-paste presets** (all-claude, tuned, GPT adversarial review, codex-implements, antigravity/`agy`, opencode, budget): `docs/model-presets.md` in the bee repo — including the `bash -lc '… "$(cat)"'` wrapper every CLI that cannot read the prompt from stdin (`agy`, `opencode`) needs to satisfy the stdin transport in step 3 below.

- **ceiling** = the strongest model in play = **the session model itself** (no config entry). A ceiling cell inherits the session model — omit the `model` param **and** carry the `[bee-tier: ceiling]` marker, anchored to the first non-whitespace token of the prompt or the start of the description (decision 0023 — a marker anywhere else never counts). Keep it scarce: planning, integration, architecture, final review only. Touch it on every dispatch and the saving evaporates.
- **generation** = the mid worker that runs the loops (implementation, test writing). Where the bulk of dispatches go.
- **extraction** = cheapest capable (retrieval, mechanical edits).
- A **null** tier means the runtime cannot switch per-agent models (Codex today) → state the tier in the worker prompt and enforce it as a read budget + output cap. Set real ids (e.g. `"generation": "gpt-5"`) only if your runtime supports per-agent selection.

Resolve a tier for the active runtime before spawning:

```
node .bee/bin/bee.mjs status --json    # .models shows both runtime maps
```

Or in code: `resolveTier(root, tier, runtime, purpose?)` from `lib/state.mjs` returns a typed dispatch — `{type:'inherit'}` (ceiling → omit the model param and carry the anchored `[bee-tier: ceiling]` marker), `{type:'model', model}`, `{type:'budget'}` (prompt-enforced tier, anchored `[bee-tier: <tier>]` marker), `{type:'cli', command}` (external executor, below — only when `purpose` is the explicit `{for:'gather'}`), or `{type:'refused', reason:'cli_tier_gather_only', slot, fix}` (a cli-shaped tier resolving without `{for:'gather'}` — AO12/B1, plan 2A-ii). The optional 4th param `purpose` is shaped `{for:'gather'|'cell'}` and **defaults to `'cell'`** — the fail-safe side: every bare 3-arg call, and any missing/malformed `purpose`, resolves cli-shaped values as a refusal; only an explicit `{for:'gather'}` unlocks `{type:'cli'}`. Non-cli values ignore `purpose` entirely. The legacy `modelForTier` still returns a model name or `null` (it calls `resolveTier` with no purpose, so cli keeps degrading to `null` exactly as before this change). Two shapes, one map: keep the strongest model as `ceiling` and it stays scarce as the orchestrator (fan-out).

Every dispatch carries an explicit tier marker (decision 0023, hardened per P1-1): `inherit` needs the [bee-tier: ceiling] marker anchored to the first non-whitespace token of the prompt, or the description must start with it; `budget` needs the matching [bee-tier: <tier>] marker anchored the same way, stated alongside the budget in the prompt. A marker anywhere else — embedded mid-prompt or mid-description — never satisfies the transport, and a bare dispatch with neither the model param nor an anchored marker is denied by the model-guard hook.

**Dispatch economics (GH #22 P1-6 D3):** `.bee/config.json` names the **requested** model for a tier — what should run, never a guarantee of what did. Every dispatch the guard evaluates (allowed or denied) now logs the honest split in `.bee/logs/dispatch.jsonl`: `logical_tier` (the declared tier), `requested_model` (what config names, when resolvable), `effective_model` + `effective_model_status`, `channel` (the transport family), and `enforcement` (the mechanism). A real structural `model` param on a claude Agent/Task dispatch is `pinned` — `effective_model` equals that param, because the param is something we actually watched the caller pass. A claude dispatch carrying only the `[bee-tier: <t>]` marker (no param — the prompt-budget style) is `unverified` — `requested_model` may still name the tier's configured model, informationally, but nothing pins the dispatch to it. On **codex-native** transport (`spawn_agent`), the effective model is `inherited-or-unknown` **always** — codex-cli 0.144.4 has no per-agent model selection at all, so this status never flips to `pinned` no matter what the tier resolves to; only a future capability probe proving per-agent selection would justify moving it. A **cli-exec** dispatch (external executor, below) is `unverified` too — the command names its own model in its own argv, outside this vocabulary, so `requested_model` is always `null` there.

## External Executors — Multi-Provider Workers (P14, decision 0019)

A configurable tier may name an **external CLI executor** instead of a model — that is how GPT/Codex, GLM, Kimi, or any other provider's CLI becomes a bee worker while Claude (or Codex) stays the orchestrator:

```json
"models": {
  "claude": {
    "extraction": "haiku",
    "generation": { "kind": "cli", "command": "codex exec --json -m gpt-5.3-codex -c model_reasoning_effort=high --full-auto" }
  }
}
```

**Dispatch guard — what never routes to a cli executor** (codex-first field notes): a cell whose work needs the *session's* tools — MCP servers (browser, computer-use), credential managers, secrets reads, or anything only the orchestrating harness can reach — stays on a native tier; the external process cannot see those tools and will improvise instead of failing loudly. Destructive/irreversible operations (pushes, releases, external-system mutations) also never go external.

**Status (AO12/B1, plan 2A-ii/2A-iii):** `resolveTier` now purpose-scopes cli resolution — a bare/cell-purpose resolve of a cli-shaped tier **refuses** (`{type:'refused', reason:'cli_tier_gather_only'}`); only the explicit `resolveTier(root, slot, runtime, {for:'gather'})` reaches `{type:'cli'}`. Cli cell execution — the reserve/verify/cap/release worker contract described below — stays **gated behind W9's absolute-path dogfood** and is not dispatched today; a cli-shaped tier serves gathers only, through the Delegation contract's cli gather branch (`bee-hive/references/routing-and-contracts.md`), which has no reservation, no cap, and no `result.json` — stdout **is** the digest. This section documents the cell-execution contract for when W9 lands; do not dispatch a cell to a cli-shaped tier under the protocol below until then.

**Dispatch protocol** (`resolveTier(root, slot, runtime, {for:'gather'}).type === 'cli'`):

1. **Prompt file, never shell-quoted args:** write the standard worker prompt (Worker Prompt Template below, verbatim — same contract, same status tokens) **plus the cli-dispatch suffix from step 2** to `.bee/workers/<cell-id>.prompt.md`. The external worker starts with ZERO session context — the prompt carries goal, exact paths, constraints, non-goals, and the proof expected (the cell's verify command); spec quality decides success. The prompt file **is the contract**, at a stable path: it outlives the process, the worker re-reads it if it loses the thread, and rescue rounds reference it (`re-read .bee/workers/<cell-id>.prompt.md`) instead of re-pasting the spec. If dispatch ever runs in an isolated worktree, surface the same contract as a short block in that workspace's AGENTS.md — the one file external CLIs reliably read first.
2. **Finish contract — the cli-dispatch suffix**, appended verbatim to the template:

   ```text
   Cli dispatch extras:
   - This contract lives at .bee/workers/<CELL_ID>.prompt.md — re-read it if you lose the thread.
   - Your last FILE act, after capping and releasing but BEFORE returning the
     final status-token message: write .bee/workers/<CELL_ID>.result.json:
     { "cell_id": "<CELL_ID>", "outcome": "done|blocked|handoff|noop",
       "verify_command": "<the cell verify command>", "verify_passed": true|false,
       "files_changed": ["<paths>"], "notes": "<one line>" }
   ```

   The outcome vocabulary is exactly the four status tokens — `result.json` is the cli **transport** of the same worker contract as the native markdown results, never a second contract. Exiting is not signaling; a worker that only exits has not finished.
3. **Spawn detached, output to files:** before launching — first dispatch or any resume round — delete any existing `.bee/workers/<cell-id>.result.json`; a stale result must never satisfy a later attempt. Run the configured command as a background process, prompt via stdin, final message to a dedicated file where the CLI supports it (codex: `-o .bee/workers/<cell-id>.result.md`), raw stream to a job log with stderr suppressed — thinking noise bloats the orchestrator's context; re-enable stderr only to debug a failing run. E.g. `<command> -o .bee/workers/<id>.result.md - < .bee/workers/<id>.prompt.md > .bee/workers/<id>.out.log 2>/dev/null`. Keep the launcher's job handle — its exit event is the "process ended" signal step 5 waits on. Record the worker (nickname, cell, `executor: cli`) in `.bee/state.json` as usual.
4. **Tend by artifact, not by chat:** the external worker runs the same `.bee/bin` helpers (reserve → verify → cap → release) because they are plain node scripts — the cell status and reservations ARE the progress signal. Poll `node .bee/bin/bee.mjs cells show --id <id>` and read `.bee/workers/<cell-id>.result.json` for the final outcome; never parse the raw JSONL stream. A quiet run is not a dead run — do not kill on silence alone.
5. **Accept by file, never by exit:** once the process ends, a cli run counts only if `result.json` exists, parses, and carries a valid outcome. Missing, unparseable, or invalid-outcome result = a failed run, routed to rescue (step 7) — never accepted, never silently waited on.
6. **Trust boundary is decision 0018, doubly:** an external worker's `done` is never accepted on its word — the orchestrator ALWAYS re-runs the cell's verify itself and runs `bee.mjs cells judge --id <id>`. External executors never get the tiny/small spot-check relaxation; every external cell is goal-checked. The result file is a signal, never the evidence.
7. **Rescue — resume before re-dispatch:** on a goal-check miss or a failed acceptance (step 5), prefer the CLI's session-resume (codex: `codex exec resume --last`, run from the repo dir; resume inherits the original session's sandbox/config — do not re-pass sandbox flags) with a short prompt carrying the diagnostic that applies — the failing verify output for a goal-check miss, or the acceptance failure (missing/unparseable/invalid `result.json`) for a step-5 reject — plus the contract path. It keeps the worker's context and costs far less than a fresh run. **After 2 failed resume rounds, stop ping-ponging:** mark `[BLOCKED]` and climb the normal rescue ladder (a stuck/garbled run is killed and re-dispatched; the tier rung may swap `cli` for a native model tier when the provider itself is failing).

Constraints: the external CLI must be able to edit the repo working tree and run node (the `.bee/bin` contract); grant write access scoped to the repo only (codex: `-s workspace-write`) — never a machine-wide bypass (`--yolo`-style flags) as the house default; the 0018 goal-check exists so bee does not have to *trust* the worker, not so it can hand over the machine. Secrets: the external process gets only its own provider's credentials from the user's environment — bee passes none.

**Transient hygiene (workers-prune):** dispatch transients (`<cell-id>.prompt.md`, `.out*.log`, `.result.md|json`, reviewer/plan-check logs) accumulate in `.bee/workers/` and are never needed after the feature closes. At feature close — after review acceptance, before the closing commit — the orchestrator runs `node .bee/bin/bee.mjs state worker prune` (`--dry-run` to preview). Keep-rules protect transients of active workers and non-capped cells (re-read immediately before the destructive loop, C1), and files outside the transient suffix set (evidence snapshots, cell payloads, subdirectories) are never touched — but prune is still the orchestrator's feature-close verb, not something to race against an in-flight dispatch round.

## Worker Prompt Template

Nicknames are Minions character names (decision 3d55b976, human-confirmed f4c4a162) — recognizable,
consistent worker identities; the assigned cell stays authoritative for responsibilities.

```text
You are a bee worker subagent.

Identity:
- Agent nickname (reservation identity): <NICKNAME>
- Assigned cell id: <CELL_ID>
- Feature: <FEATURE>
- Model tier: <extraction|generation|ceiling> (model: <MODEL_NAME>)
- Advisor (optional — present only when the advisor resolves and is not the worker's own model, the same-model no-op, AO4/AO5): <ADVISOR_MODEL_OR_CLI_COMMAND> — consult via <TRANSPORT>

Inputs — read these; nothing else will be provided:
- docs/history/<FEATURE>/CONTEXT.md
- docs/history/<FEATURE>/plan.md
- Global constraints: <GLOBAL_CONSTRAINTS — locked D-IDs, prohibitions, budgets>

Contract:
- Load the bee-executing skill immediately and follow its loop exactly.
- Execute only the assigned cell. Do not select or accept other work.
- Reserve every file before writing, under your nickname.
- Prefix write-heavy shell commands with BEE_AGENT_NAME="<NICKNAME>".
- Return exactly one final status token: [DONE], [BLOCKED], [HANDOFF], or [NOOP],
  followed by the result fields, and write a report to docs/history/<FEATURE>/reports/.

Startup:
1. Read AGENTS.md.
2. Run node .bee/bin/bee.mjs status --json
3. Read docs/history/<FEATURE>/CONTEXT.md, then run node .bee/bin/bee.mjs cells show --id <CELL_ID>
4. Reserve, implement, verify, cap, release, report.
```

The `Advisor` line is omitted entirely — a session whose config has no advisor slot dispatches byte-identical prompts to today — whenever no advisor resolves, or the advisor's model name literally matches the worker's own resolved model (the one honest no-op). Ceiling-tier workers are no longer a skip condition — config is the authority and the orchestrator does not second-guess it with a strength ladder (AO5). The same-model no-op is the orchestrator's, run at dispatch, never left to the worker (AO4 + AO5). When present, `<TRANSPORT>` states the proven transport verbatim, matching what bee-executing's Advisor Consult section tells the worker to run:
for a **cli-shaped** advisor, `<the configured command>, evidence bundle on stdin` (External Executors output-capture discipline, above).

Never include session history, other cells, or the orchestrator's reasoning. If a worker needs more than this contract, the cell failed cold-pickup review — route the gap back, do not widen the prompt with transcript.

## Result Formats (expected back from workers)

Native subagents return these token-markdown reports as their final message. Cli executors deliver the **same four outcomes** as `.bee/workers/<cell-id>.result.json` (External Executors, step 2) — one contract, two transports.

```text
[DONE] <cell-id>: <title>
Nickname: <name>
Files modified: <paths>
Reservations: reserved <paths>; released yes|no
Verification: <command> -> passed
Commit: <hash>
Next action: <suggestion for the orchestrator>
```

```text
[BLOCKED] <cell-id> - <summary>
Requested files: <paths>
Blocker: <conflict | failing verification | ambiguity | locked-decision conflict>
What happened: <description + diagnosis>
What I need next: <specific parent action>
```

```text
[HANDOFF] <cell-id or none>
Reason: <context high / safe pause>
Progress: <done so far>
Reservations: <active paths or none>
Resume: read .bee/HANDOFF.json, node .bee/bin/bee.mjs cells show --id <cell-id>, reservation list
```

```text
[NOOP] No safe assigned cell
Reason: <missing, already capped, or unavailable>
Suggested next action: <re-check ready set, fix assignment, respawn later>
```

On each result: update the cell if the worker could not (`block` with reason), clear the worker from `.bee/state.json`, and confirm with `node .bee/bin/bee.mjs reservations list --active-only` that nothing leaked.

## Handoff JSON

Near 65% context, write `.bee/HANDOFF.json`: `{ phase, feature, mode, cells_in_flight, done, remaining, next_action, written_at }`. Include the resume commands:

```text
node .bee/bin/bee.mjs status --json
node .bee/bin/bee.mjs cells ready
node .bee/bin/bee.mjs reservations list --active-only
```

## Red Flags

- spawning before Gate 3 approval
- full-context forks for routine cells
- worker edits without reservations, or the orchestrator editing anything
- passive waiting while cells/reservations are unhealthy
- conflict resolution by optimism ("they'll probably touch different lines")
- results collected but state.json / cells not updated
- session history in a worker prompt
