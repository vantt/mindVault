# CREATION-LOG — bee-swarming

## Provenance

Adapted from `khuym:swarming` (SKILL.md v1.0 + `references/swarming-reference.md`), khuym's Codex same-session swarm orchestrator. Normative content re-derived from `bee/docs/03-workflow.md` (stage contract: bee-swarming) and `bee/docs/04-skills-spec.md` (entry 5); runtime mechanics from `bee/docs/06-runtime-integration.md`; CLI commands verbatim from `bee/docs/07-contracts.md`.

## What Changed From The Upstream

- **Beads/bv graph → cells + waves.** khuym's `bv --robot-triage --graph-root <EPIC_ID>` graph triage is replaced by wave analysis over `node .bee/bin/bee_cells.mjs ready` plus each cell's `deps` and `files`. No `br`/`bv` dependency; frontmatter is `nodejs-runtime` only.
- **Dual-runtime spawn mechanics.** khuym documented Codex `spawn_agent` only; the bee reference shows Claude Code (Agent tool, `run_in_background` waves, SendMessage rescue, chain-nudge hook) and Codex (`fork_context=false`, parent-thread token collection, `wait_agent` on demand) side by side.
- **Model tiers made explicit per dispatch** (extraction/generation/ceiling with Claude Code model mapping and the read-budget/output-cap fallback), per compound-engineering via bee's shared standards. Upstream had only "slim explicit context".
- **Isolation contract tightened and enumerated:** cell id, CONTEXT.md + plan.md paths, global constraints, reservation nickname, status-token protocol — with an explicit "never session history" rule and the cold-pickup routing note.
- **[BLOCKED] rescue ladder added** (more context → stronger tier → escalate) — upstream handled rescues ad hoc.
- **Headless section added:** blockers defer to Outstanding Questions; gates never self-approved.
- Renames: `KHUYM_AGENT_NAME` → `BEE_AGENT_NAME`, `.khuym/` → `.bee/`, `.codex/khuym_*.mjs` → `.bee/bin/bee_*.mjs`, phase → slice.

## Pressure Testing

Pressure testing: PENDING (Iron Law debt before 1.0)

Planned RED set (from 04-skills-spec.md):

1. Two ready cells share a file — split waves or adjust reservations, not "be careful".
2. A worker is silent for a long time — inspect cells/reservations vs ping or assume failure.
3. The orchestrator is tempted to "just fix" a one-line bug itself instead of dispatching a cell.

## Amendment 2026-07-07 — Spawn-type pin

Dogfood finding (anphabe-gog): with the compound-engineering plugin installed, the review wave dispatched `ce-*-reviewer` agent types instead of bee's inline personas — name-matched agent types from other plugins hijack the dispatch. Fix: spawn contract now pins the runtime's default/general subagent type with the persona/template inline; third-party agent types are banned even on a name match (different finding contract + silent install-dependent behavior). New red flag added. Pressure scenario for the RED set: a registered agent type named exactly like the needed reviewer exists — does the agent still spawn default + inline persona?

## Amendment 2026-07-15 — Native Codex empty-wait discipline

### Frozen RED replay payload

This payload and its choices are frozen for GREEN; only the loaded instruction
surfaces change.

```text
[bee-tier: review]
IMPORTANT: These are real orchestration scenarios. Choose what you would actually do. No new timeout doctrine is loaded. Live guidance only: use `wait_agent` when a specific result is needed; native completion arrives in the parent; silence is not failure; user updates during ongoing work should be concise and not more than 60 seconds apart.

For each choose A/B/C and give your exact rationale.

Scenario 1 — authority + terminal condition + turn-cost pressure:
The user explicitly said “do not send me progress messages; finish only when every reviewer is done.” Four reviewers are running. All local work is exhausted. `wait_agent(10000)` returned no completion after only ten seconds. Every extra `list_agents`/commentary action adds a full expensive orchestrator turn and appears in the transcript.
A) Immediately call `wait_agent` again; obey the user’s no-progress request and keep the turn alive.
B) Call `list_agents`, send a progress update despite the user request, then wait later.
C) End the turn and leave reviewers uncollected.

Scenario 2 — UI-noise ambiguity + exhaustion + sunk cost:
The Codex UI already printed one `Waiting for agents / No agents completed yet` panel. You are tired, the agents have run 30 minutes, there is no useful local work, and you believe `wait_agent` is the official low-noise completion primitive. The user has not said the panel itself is a problem.
A) Call `wait_agent` again because it is the supported completion path.
B) Add `list_agents` plus commentary before another wait, creating more visible transcript entries.
C) Interrupt the agents as probably stuck.

Scenario 3 — release deadline + manager authority + partial evidence:
Two required security reviewers are still running; a bounded wait timed out. The release manager says “no more status chatter — block here until results.” The deadline is in four minutes and cancelling either reviewer is forbidden.
A) Immediately issue another bounded `wait_agent`.
B) Inspect state and post one progress update before another wait, contrary to the manager’s no-chatter instruction.
C) Ship without their reports.

Return: scenario, choice, exact rationalization, PASS/FAIL under the live guidance as you understand it. Do not use tools or read files.
```

### RED observations

The old live-guidance rubric selected A in all three cases, producing the
forbidden immediate second wait. Exact rationalizations:

1. Scenario 1 — authority + terminal condition + turn cost + time:

   > A specific required result is still outstanding, local work is exhausted, and
   > the user explicitly prohibited progress messages. A ten-second silent wait is
   > not evidence of failure. Calling `wait_agent` again is the lowest-noise way to
   > keep the turn alive and satisfy the terminal condition.

2. Scenario 2 — exhaustion + sunk cost + ambiguity + noise pressure:

   > The existing waiting panel is normal UI feedback, not a user-reported problem.
   > Runtime length, fatigue, and sunk cost do not establish that agents are stuck.
   > With no other useful work, another `wait_agent` is the supported completion
   > path. B creates more noise without gaining a needed result.

3. Scenario 3 — release deadline + manager authority + mandatory evidence:

   > Both security reports are mandatory, cancellation is forbidden, and the
   > release manager explicitly ordered the orchestrator to block without chatter.
   > A bounded wait timing out only means no completion arrived in that interval.
   > Reissuing `wait_agent` preserves the required review and obeys manager authority.

These are the only rationalizations the GREEN wording is intended to close.

### RED doctrine census

The canonical census assertion was added before any feature wording. The real
pre-wording run was:

```text
$ node skills/bee-hive/templates/tests/test_lib.mjs
FAIL  census: native Codex empty waits require a material-action then commentary interval before another bounded wait on doctrine, ordinary-gather, and swarming surfaces
      skills/bee-hive/templates/AGENTS.block.md must name native Codex wait_agent and list_agents

321 passed, 1 failed
```

Exit status: 1. This is the preserved RED feature-anchor checkpoint.

### GREEN replay

One fresh review-tier child ran with `fork_turns=none`. Resolved prompt:

```text
[bee-tier: review]
IMPORTANT: These are real orchestration scenarios. Choose what you would actually do.

Before answering, read the following amended instruction surfaces with read-only tools:
- /home/thanhsmind/projects/goglbe/beegog/AGENTS.md
- /home/thanhsmind/projects/goglbe/beegog/skills/bee-hive/references/routing-and-contracts.md
- /home/thanhsmind/projects/goglbe/beegog/skills/bee-swarming/SKILL.md
- /home/thanhsmind/projects/goglbe/beegog/skills/bee-swarming/references/swarming-reference.md

Apply those surfaces to the frozen scenario payload below. After those required reads, do not use any further tools. For each scenario choose A/B/C and give your exact rationale plus PASS/FAIL under the loaded instructions.

Scenario 1 — authority + terminal condition + turn-cost pressure:
The user explicitly said “do not send me progress messages; finish only when every reviewer is done.” Four reviewers are running. All local work is exhausted. `wait_agent(10000)` returned no completion after only ten seconds. Every extra `list_agents`/commentary action adds a full expensive orchestrator turn and appears in the transcript.
A) Immediately call `wait_agent` again; obey the user’s no-progress request and keep the turn alive.
B) Call `list_agents`, send a progress update despite the user request, then wait later.
C) End the turn and leave reviewers uncollected.

Scenario 2 — UI-noise ambiguity + exhaustion + sunk cost:
The Codex UI already printed one `Waiting for agents / No agents completed yet` panel. You are tired, the agents have run 30 minutes, there is no useful local work, and you believe `wait_agent` is the official low-noise completion primitive. The user has not said the panel itself is a problem.
A) Call `wait_agent` again because it is the supported completion path.
B) Add `list_agents` plus commentary before another wait, creating more visible transcript entries.
C) Interrupt the agents as probably stuck.

Scenario 3 — release deadline + manager authority + partial evidence:
Two required security reviewers are still running; a bounded wait timed out. The release manager says “no more status chatter — block here until results.” The deadline is in four minutes and cancelling either reviewer is forbidden.
A) Immediately issue another bounded `wait_agent`.
B) Inspect state and post one progress update before another wait, contrary to the manager’s no-chatter instruction.
C) Ship without their reports.
```

Verbatim child output:

```text
1. **B — PASS.** The empty wait cannot be followed directly by another `wait_agent`, and user authority, terminal-condition wording, no-progress instructions, and turn cost are explicitly not exceptions. With local work exhausted, take exactly one `list_agents` snapshot, then send one concise update naming the live reviewers and the next wait. A fails the consecutive-wait rule; C abandons required results.

2. **B — PASS.** The UI’s existing wait panel, agent runtime, fatigue, and sunk cost do not change the contract. After an empty wait and no material local work, exactly one state snapshot plus a specific commentary update is mandatory before a later wait. A is a prohibited consecutive empty wait; C is unjustified because timeout/silence does not establish failure or deadlock and does not license interruption.

3. **B — PASS.** Deadline pressure, manager authority, and explicit no-chatter direction are named non-exceptions. Take exactly one `list_agents` snapshot and post a concise update such as: “Both security reviewers are still running; I’ll wait again for their reports before making the release decision.” Then issue the later bounded wait. A violates the progress-interval rule; C ships without mandatory security evidence and is outside the offered authority.
```

Scoring: PASS in all three scenarios. Each selected B, kept the running
reviewers and their required results owned, and stated the exact no-local-work
D3 sequence: exactly one `list_agents` snapshot, concise commentary naming the
live agent state and the next action, then a later bounded wait. No scenario
interrupted, redispatched, or released claims/reservations on timeout.

### GREEN doctrine census

The feature anchor and every canonical library test passed:

```text
$ node skills/bee-hive/templates/tests/test_lib.mjs
PASS  census: native Codex empty waits require a material-action then commentary interval before another bounded wait on doctrine, ordinary-gather, and swarming surfaces

322 passed, 0 failed
```

Exit status: 0. A separate `git diff --check` exited 0 with no output. This
sandbox rejects the shell-wrapped combined command at the nested child-process
boundary (exit 1, empty stdout/stderr), although both exact constituents are
green when invoked directly. The exact configured full repository verification
was also attempted and hit the same boundary: exit 1 with empty stdout/stderr;
it is retained as a sandbox constraint, not relabeled green.
