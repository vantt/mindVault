# Planning Reference

Use when `bee-planning` needs artifact templates, cell quality rules, or shape guidance.

## Artifact fan-out — separate files are earned, not default (decision 0009)

`plan.md` is the truth artifact for **standard/high-risk** lanes (and small only when opt-in). Tiny drops it entirely and small skips it by default (D3/D4) — the cell(s) and the logged scoping synthesis carry the shape. Where `plan.md` exists, discovery and approach content default to **sections inside it**; they graduate to their own files only when real complexity makes a standalone file worth reading on its own. The dogfood lesson: a small/standard feature that spawned `discovery.md` + `approach.md` + `plan.md` + `implement-plan.md` restated the same "current state" four times.

| Artifact | Separate file when | Otherwise |
|---|---|---|
| `plan.md` | standard/high-risk (frozen at Gate 2), or small when a durable multi-slice/product-decision doc is genuinely needed | **tiny: none** — request + one cell (D3); **small: opt-in** — a logged scoping synthesis + 1–3 cells is the default (D4) |
| `discovery.md` | discovery ran at **L2/L3** (a real multi-candidate comparison worth preserving) | a `## Discovery` note inside `plan.md` (L0/L1 findings, cited) |
| `approach.md` | **high-risk** lane, or discovery **L2+** (rejected alternatives + a risk map substantial enough to stand alone) | an `## Approach` section inside `plan.md` |
| `implement-plan.md` (via `bee-briefing`) | **high-risk** (mandatory) | **standard**: on-demand — `plan.md` + the Gate 2 chat layer are the review record; render only if the user asks or the slice spans multiple domains. `small`: optional mini-brief on request. `tiny`/`spike`: none |

Rule of thumb: if the separate file would just repeat what `plan.md` already says, it should have been a section. Fold, don't fan out.

## Artifact: approach.md (only when the fan-out table calls for a separate file)

```markdown
# Approach: <Feature>

## Recommended path
<2–5 sentences: what we build and in what order. Cites D-IDs.>

## Rejected alternatives
- <alternative> — <why rejected, one line>

## Risk map
| Component | Risk | Reason | Proof needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| <area> | LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH | <why> | <command, inspection, or spike question> |

## Files and order
<bounded list, likely touch order>

## Relevant learnings
- <docs/history/learnings file or decision id> — <what it changes here>

## Questions for validating
- <assumption that could invalidate the path>
```

## Artifact: plan.md (standard/high-risk; small only when opt-in)

Frozen at Gate 2 (D1): once `approved_gates.shape` is set the content sections are immutable — the only permitted post-approval write is the approval stamp in the frontmatter. No requirements-only→implementation-ready mutation, no in-place enrichment.

```markdown
---
artifact_contract: bee-plan/v1
mode: standard | high-risk | spike | small (opt-in)
# approved_gate2: <unset until Gate 2; then a date stamp — the only permitted post-approval write>
---

# Plan: <Feature>

Mode: `<mode>` — <k> risk flags: <list, or "none">
Why this is the least workflow that protects the work: <one sentence>

## Requirements (from CONTEXT.md)
- D1: <locked decision restated> ...

## Discovery
<Only when discovery ran at L0/L1 and there is no separate discovery.md.
2–4 lines: what was inspected, the finding, the evidence command. At L2/L3 this
becomes its own discovery.md and this section is a one-line pointer to it.>

## Approach
<Only when the fan-out table keeps approach in plan.md (not high-risk, not L2+).
Recommended path (cites D-IDs) · rejected alternatives (one line each) · a compact
risk map (component / LOW-MEDIUM-HIGH / proof needed). When approach.md exists as
its own file, drop this section and point to it instead.>

## Shape
<one of the bodies below, by mode>

## Test matrix
<edge dimensions that apply (see edge-dimensions.md), at lane depth:
tiny/small = the 2–3 dimensions that bite; standard = one pass over all 12;
high-risk = probes written out per dimension>

## Out of scope
<explicitly not solved; deferred ideas stay deferred>
```

No `## Current slice` / `## Cells` sections are added post-approval: the plan is frozen (D1) and the current slice lives **only in cells** (D2). Prep creates the cells; the plan is never re-opened to index them.

**Shape bodies by mode:**

- `tiny` — no plan.md (D3): the cell `action` is the micro-plan (current work outcome, proof command, out of scope).
- `small` — no plan.md by default (D4): a logged scoping synthesis + 1–3 cells carry the shape; write a plan.md only when opt-in (durable multi-slice/product-decision doc).
- `spike` — the one yes/no question, what proves YES, what NO implies, `.bee/spikes/<feature>/` location.
- `standard` (milestone-shaped) — **phase plan**: `Phase | What Changes | Why Now | Demo | Unlocks` table. First phase obvious; later phases build on it; no technical buckets ("backend", "frontend" are not phases).
- `standard` / `high-risk` (capability/risk-shaped) — **epic map**: feature outcome, repo-reality basis, `Epic | Capability/Risk Area | Why It Exists | Slices | Proof Needed` table, slice queue with deps and feasibility status, current slice to prepare.

## Phase plan vs epic map

Use **phases** only when the work has observable milestones a user could demo in order. Use an **epic map** when capability or risk areas explain the work more honestly than a timeline — typical for `high-risk` (it defaults to epic map + mandatory feasibility proof). Never force 2–4 phases onto work that is really one slice, and never use phases as architecture layers.

## Cell quality rules

A cell is an executable prompt a cold worker can pick up with zero session history.

1. **Directive action, no code blocks.** Prose that says what to do and cites decisions (`per D2`). Code belongs in the repo, written by the worker.
2. **Bounded files.** `files` lists everything the worker may write; `read_first` what it must read. A worker touching other paths returns `[BLOCKED]`. Cross-cell file overlap is legal, not a scoping error — it only costs a wave (auto-serialized per D2); prefer explicit paths or trailing-`*` patterns in `files`, since overlap detection uses `pathsOverlap` semantics (mid-path globs are treated as literals, not wildcards).
3. **Testable exit.** `verify` is a real command that runs in this repo today. "Manually check" is not a verify.
4. **must_haves are contracts:** `truths` (observable behavior), `artifacts` (path + substantive description — no stub counts), `key_links` (wired, not just existing), `prohibitions` (what must NOT change). Required for `standard` and `high-risk` lanes; `tiny` may omit.
5. **behavior_change honesty.** Any cell changing observable behavior is `behavior_change: true` — the cap helper refuses these without both verification evidence and a "before" characterization (`red_failure_evidence`), and reviewing double-checks it; mislabeling is a P1 waiting to happen.
6. **Deps are real.** `deps` lists cell ids whose output this cell needs. Ready = all deps capped.
7. **Current slice only.** If you can write the cell without knowing the previous slice's outcome, fine; if it belongs to a later slice, it does not exist yet.
8. **Evidence lives in the trace — do not manufacture evidence artifacts (decision 0009).** Never add a `reports/execution-*-evidence.md` or `reports/<cell>-evidence.json` to a cell's `must_haves.artifacts`. Verification evidence belongs in the cell trace (`verification_evidence` + `verify_output`), which is the single source; requiring a parallel evidence file duplicates it and inflates the doc set. `artifacts` are the *product* the cell builds (a source file, a spec, a migration) — not a record of the cell having run.

## Example cell JSON (schema per docs/02-architecture.md)

```json
{
  "id": "auth-3",
  "feature": "auth",
  "title": "Wire session middleware into API router",
  "lane": "standard",
  "status": "open",
  "deps": ["auth-1", "auth-2"],
  "decisions": ["D2", "D4"],
  "files": ["src/api/router.ts", "src/auth/middleware.ts"],
  "read_first": ["src/api/router.ts"],
  "action": "Mount the session middleware from auth-2 onto all /api/* routes (per D2). Preserve the existing public response envelope (per D4). Follow the error-handler registration pattern already used in router.ts.",
  "must_haves": {
    "truths": ["Unauthenticated /api/* requests return 401"],
    "artifacts": [{"path": "src/auth/middleware.ts", "substantive": "exports authGuard, no TODO stubs"}],
    "key_links": ["router.ts imports and mounts authGuard"],
    "prohibitions": ["No change to public response envelope"]
  },
  "verify": "npm test -- auth",
  "trace": {
    "worker": null, "outcome": null, "files_changed": [],
    "deviations": [], "friction": null, "capped_at": null,
    "behavior_change": true, "verification_evidence": null
  }
}
```

Create with one batched stdin call for the whole slice (a JSON array; a single object works for a one-cell slice — do not write per-cell scratchpad files):

```bash
node .bee/bin/bee.mjs cells add --stdin <<'EOF'
[ { ...cell 1... }, { ...cell 2... } ]
EOF
```

A batch is all-or-nothing: every cell is validated (including duplicate ids within the batch) before any is written. The helper validates id, feature, title, lane, action, verify — and non-empty `must_haves.truths` for `standard`/`high-risk`. Fix rejects; never downgrade the lane to dodge validation.

## Trace of shapes

```text
mode -> shape (plan.md, frozen at Gate 2) -> [GATE 2] -> cells
```

(Tiny/small have no plan.md in this trace: `mode -> draft-cell preview + reality check -> [merged gate] -> cells`, D3/D4/D5.)
