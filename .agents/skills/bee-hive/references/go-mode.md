# Go Mode — Step-by-Step Reference

Load this when executing go mode. Go mode is the full bee pipeline from raw feature request to compounded learnings, closing verified but `unreviewed` (decision 565e68d0). It chains every skill in sequence with up to **3 human gates** (fewer when the opt-in gate-bypass switch is on — see the end of this file). Each gate protects the next irreversible commitment. **Go mode never auto-enters independent review** (SPEC R1) — `bee-reviewing` and its Gate 4 are a separate, user-invoked flow layered over a completed scope; see the boxed note after the diagram.

Trigger: `/go [feature]`, "run the full pipeline", or "go mode".

**Lane fast paths short-circuit this diagram** (bee-hive Modes and Lanes): `docs` lane skips the pipeline entirely (announce → write → format-check → capture). `tiny`/`small` collapse Steps 2–5 into: no plan.md (`tiny`, D3) or an opt-in scoping synthesis + plan.md (`small`, D4) → draft cell(s) previewed before persist, inline reality check → **one merged shape+execution gate** → one dispatched execution worker (AO14) → orchestrator-authored done-report → scribing. The full diagram below is the `standard`/`high-risk` pipeline.

## Pre-Pipeline: Bootstrap

Before invoking `bee-exploring`:

1. Run the State Bootstrap from `routing-and-contracts.md` (onboarding, `node .bee/bin/bee.mjs status --json`, critical-patterns, `node .bee/bin/bee.mjs decisions active --recent 3`).
2. Apply the surface-scope-earlier check — clear acceptance criteria plus pattern references may skip Step 1 with user approval.
3. Determine the feature slug (lowercase-hyphenated) and create `docs/history/<feature>/` if missing.
4. Update `.bee/state.json`: `feature: <slug>`, `phase: exploring`, `mode: null` (set at the mode gate).

## Gate Wording (fixed)

- **Gate 1:** "Decisions locked. Approve CONTEXT.md before planning?"
- **Gate 2:** "Work shape is ready. Approve before current-work preparation?"
- **Gate 3:** "Feasibility validated. Approve execution?"
- **Gate 4:** P1 > 0 → "P1 findings block merge. Fix before proceeding?" ; P1 = 0 → "Review complete. Approve merge?"

Each gate is one question in the standard CONTEXT / QUESTION / RECOMMENDATION / options format, presented per the **Gate Presentation Contract** (`routing-and-contracts.md`): plain-language layer in chat, in the user's language; full mechanical report written to `docs/history/<feature>/reports/` and linked, never pasted. Gates are asked **one at a time** — never batch Gate 2 and Gate 3 into a single question for `standard`/`high-risk` work, even when validation looks trivially clean. The **one designed exception** is the `tiny`/`small` merged shape+execution gate (bee-hive Modes and Lanes): there the inline reality check plus one merged question IS the contract, and `tiny` closes with a done-report instead of Gate 4. Optional at Gates 2–4: a cross-model second opinion; disagreement is quoted to the user, never auto-resolved.

## Gate Presentations

Templates below are the **human layer** — fill them in the user's language, in the user's terms. Square-bracket content is plain prose, never table dumps or jargon.

**GATE 1** — after exploring:

```text
What we decided: [the feature in one plain sentence] — [N] choices locked, [M] questions still open.
The key choices, in plain words: [max 3, one line each; more → "full list in CONTEXT.md"]
If a choice is wrong: everything after this builds on it — fixing it now costs a conversation, fixing it later costs redone work.
You are deciding: whether these choices match what you meant, before any planning starts.
Full record: docs/history/<feature>/CONTEXT.md
Decisions locked. Approve CONTEXT.md before planning? (yes / revise / show full CONTEXT.md)
```

Revise → return to exploring for the specific gray areas, update CONTEXT.md in place, re-present.

**GATE 2** — after the planning shape pass:

```text
What I plan to build: [the shape in one plain sentence]. Size: [mode, glossed — e.g. "standard — a normal mid-size feature"].
Why this size: [one plain sentence — the least workflow that honestly protects the work].
If the shape is wrong: preparation gets built against it — revising now is cheap, revising after prep is not.
You are deciding: whether this is the right thing and the right size, before detailed preparation.
Full plan: docs/history/<feature>/plan.md
Work shape is ready. Approve before current-work preparation? (yes / revise / show full plan.md)
```

Revise → return to the shape pass, update `plan.md` content (unapproved — pre-Gate-2 content edits are allowed; frozen only once `approved_gates.shape` is set, D1), re-present.

**GATE 3** — after validating:

```text
What I'm about to do: [the change in the user's terms, one sentence — what changes for them, not the mechanism].
Why it's trustworthy: [the single strongest piece of evidence, plain words — e.g. "a dry run rebuilt all 3 pages byte-for-byte identical"].
If it goes wrong: [what breaks for the user + how we'd notice — loud failure, rollback path].
You are deciding: whether I may start editing real files — this slice of work only.
Full validation report: docs/history/<feature>/reports/validation-<slice>.md
Feasibility validated. Approve execution? (yes / review cells / no — revise plan)
```

Approval covers the **current slice only**. No → return to planning or validating.

**GATE 4** — inside a user-invoked `bee-reviewing` session only (never at the end of go mode's default chain):

```text
What was built: [the shipped change in one plain sentence].
Review found: [P1 count] problems that block merge — [each named in plain words] — plus [P2+P3 count] smaller issues filed for later.
If we merge now: [the consequence in user terms — "nothing known breaks" or "X would ship broken for users who Y"].
You are deciding: whether this goes into the main branch.
Full review: docs/history/<feature>/reports/
```

- P1 > 0 → "P1 findings block merge. Fix before proceeding? (a) fix now (b) show details (c) explicit user override" — silence is not acknowledgment.
- P1 = 0 → "Review complete. Approve merge? (yes / show P2s first / no)"

Fix cells created for P1s run through swarming, then reviewing re-runs (targeted to the fix diff) before Gate 4 is re-presented. Repeat until P1 = 0 or explicit override.

## The Slice Loop

After each slice's swarm completes: later approved work remains → return to Step 3 (planning prep for the next slice) then Step 4 (validating) then Gate 3 again. Final slice done → Step 6 (bee-scribing) directly. `bee-reviewing` is never part of this loop — it is a separate flow the user invokes on demand, over whatever scope they choose, independent of slice boundaries.

## Fallback Paths

- **Spike returns NO:** STOP before Gate 3. Present "Spike [id] failed: [reason]. Current work is blocked." Options: revise approach / descope the risky part / change mode or boundaries. A workaround that "probably works" is not a path — plausibility is not evidence.
- **Feasibility evidence missing:** STOP before Gate 3. Present the missing matrix rows and required proof; route to spike or planning revision. No execution cells for that work until proof exists.
- **Plan-checker still failing after 3 iterations:** escalate — present the failing dimensions, ask "Return to planning with these specific concerns?", never iterate a 4th time silently.
- **Context hits ~65% mid-swarm:** write `.bee/HANDOFF.json`, present "[X] cells capped, [Y] in flight. Resume in a new session." End gracefully.
- **User rejects at any gate:** identify what feels wrong, return to the owning stage, update the artifact in place, re-present the same gate.

## Close-out

After compounding: set state `phase: idle`, `feature: null`, `mode: null`, summary "Go mode complete for <feature>", and delete `.bee/HANDOFF.json` if present. Report the §9 completion line from `bee_status` (verified/unreviewed candidate count) — never state or imply the feature was reviewed unless a review session actually ran and approved it.

## Headless Go Mode

`mode:headless` runs stages headlessly **between** gates only. Every gate still stops the pipeline and reports "awaiting Gate N approval" in the terminal report. Headless never self-approves a gate.

## Gate bypass in go mode (opt-in)

Separate from headless. When `.bee/config.json` `gate_bypass` is on (set via `bee-bypass-gate`), go mode does not stop at a bypassed Gate 1-3: at each, the agent takes the RECOMMENDATION, records the approval, logs a one-line audit decision, posts a short `⚡ auto-approved Gate N` line, and continues. **How far bypass reaches is level-aware** (`routing-and-contracts.md §Gate bypass` table): `normal` covers `tiny`/`small`/`standard` non-hard-gate work and the high-risk/hard-gate floor still stops for the human; `full` and `total` **lift that floor** — the human chose the level precisely to remove it — so Gates 1-3 auto-approve at **every** lane, high-risk and hard-gate included. Secret-file reads still stop under `off`/`normal`/`full`; only `total` auto-proceeds on them. With bypass off (the default), Gates 1-3 are never self-approved.

Gate 4 sits outside this entirely (SPEC R8, decision 565e68d0): bypass never creates or auto-approves a review session, so go mode reaching DONE never triggers it. If the user later invokes `bee-reviewing`, bypass may auto-approve the merge question only once P1 = 0 and every UAT item passed; any P1 or UAT fail/skip always stops for the human inside that session.
