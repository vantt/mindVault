# Phase03 — Compose Cookbook, reveal and owned clipboard

Status: **Partial — code complete; physical acceptance Pending**. Priority:3.

## Context and key insight

[Q6](../../docs/mobile-app-brainstorm-qa.md), [Keystore](../../docs/specs/mobile-keystore.md).
The existing Activity already uses FLAG_SECURE and cold/background locking.
Keep that boundary while replacing the setup/unlock-only screen with real flows.
No emulator has been established; test APK compilation is not Compose runtime proof.

## Requirements and architecture

Welcome → set up/recover local jars → unlocked Cookbook. Offer manual Cook without
Google; Connect/source/tab/column confirmation links to phase04 when available.
Keep existing1–5-jar password/biometric behavior, including password-only fallback.
Cookbook list searches label/username, shows source offline/sync/error state and
favorites/recent; tapping an entry opens a masked Dish detail with Menu context.
Reveal hides again after10 seconds. Dish Copy schedules compare-before-clear at30s;
username Copy is separate and must not be erased by an old Dish cleanup.

## Related files

- Modify `MainActivity`, `VaultScreen`, app resources and bounded screen/controller helpers.
- Add app `cookbook/` list/source/mapping/detail/paste/settings presentation files.
- Add app clipboard adapter and pure owned-reveal/clipboard policy in shared + JVM tests.
- Add Android instrumentation tests for real Compose wiring/clipboard/lifecycle;
  add required test dependencies only after compatibility is checked, no guessed versions.
- Keep release/debug isolation, backup exclusions and existing physical regressions.

## Implementation steps / TODO

- [x] Split navigation/setup/unlock/list/Cook/mapping/detail into focused components<200lines;
  provide EN/VI strings, accessibility labels and loading/empty/no-results states.
- [x] Use manual Cookbook source ID/URL + tab selection rather than add Drive picker scope;
  uncertain column roles show the confirmation preview from phase02.
- [x] Display verified-tag badge only as Recipe metadata, not prevalidated cooking proof.
  Show friendly mismatch/missing-context errors with no stale Dish or usable Copy.
- [x] Mask by default; explicit reveal/copy checks session ownership; timeout, navigation,
  edit, lock, background or new entry clears/hides the previous result.
- [x] Implement real Android ClipboardManager adapter with sensitive-content marker
  where available. Confirm successful write before toast; only clear matching owned
  text/generation, and never write after inaccessible read or replacement text.
- [x] Keep cleanup ownership outside the closing detail screen, schedule bounded30s
  work and reconcile when foreground access is legal. Android background clipboard
  restrictions mean no promise of exact background/history-wide removal.
- [x] Maintain5-minute idle/10-minute total monotonic clock; no navigation/reveal/copy
  grants a new absolute window. OnStop hides Dish and locks jars immediately.

## Success criteria and positive proof

- [x] JVM deferred-result/reveal/clipboard tests cover10s/30s edges, new copy, replacement
  text, denied read, screen close, lock/reopen and unchanged absolute session deadline.
- [x] Debug/release/test APKs compile and lint passes; no unmasked saved state, sensitive
  logging, remote favicon request or release proof harness is introduced.
- [x] Compiled UI tests assert actual setup→paste→Cook, mapping/list/search, exact Dish,
  mismatch refusal, reveal timeout, username/Dish copy and lock/background cleanup.
  Record them as **not run** until authorized device/runtime executes them.
- [ ] Physical phone observes layout/accessibility, biometric/password fallback,
  real clipboard/reveal, background/cold start,5/10-minute timers and Recents security.

## Risks and next steps

Immutable Compose strings cannot guarantee erasure. Physical clipboard/OS overlays
need honest platform limits ([Android clipboard](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/touch-and-input/copy-paste)).
Recent/favorites contain entry IDs only; remote icons/swipe conveniences/settings
extras are later UI refinement, not a claim that every Q6 sketch shipped.
Continue to real connection code; offline screens remain usable while disconnected.

Implementation exists in the production app/shared/client paths above. Final local
results and unchanged Golden evidence are recorded in [verification](reports/verification.md);
compiled physical tests remain unexecuted. No phone/account grant was used tonight.
