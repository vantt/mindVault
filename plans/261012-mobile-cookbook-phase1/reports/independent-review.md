# Independent mobile Cookbook review

Status: **No unresolved P1/P2 in the reviewed code**. Local verification passed;
owner Google/phone acceptance remains Pending.
Reviewer: agent A, independent of product author B. Date:2026-10-11 UTC.

## Scope and evidence

- Review actual Android Cookbook/session/authorization/clipboard adapters, private
  Menu cache/mapping and the canonical portable Sheets client reused by the Android bridge.
- Owned adversarial test: `shared/src/jvmTest/kotlin/dev/passchef/mobile/cookbook/CookbookAdversarialTest.kt`.
 13 tests independently executed and passed in the fresh 74-test shared JVM run.
- The 75 protected original extension/mobile tests, fixtures and recipe/crypto/vault
  sources match the 106-path baseline byte-for-byte at the latest incremental check.
- Extension recheck is separately recorded in [the report](../../reports/261012-extension-recheck.md).
  No extension production changes are part of this mobile slice.

## Findings and verified repairs

| Finding | Observed repair | Verification status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Malformed UTF-8 cache bytes silently decoded with replacement characters | Strict decoding in cache load/inventory | Independent hostile-byte test passed |
| Refresh stage created a replacement write ticket, leaving originating request busy forever | Originating ticket passed through stage/save/finally | Source rechecked; production app deferred-IO tests passed |
| Concurrent favorite/recent saves could lose a metadata update | Busy ownership spans IO; actual list actions disabled while busy | Production app deferred-IO regression passed; actual conflicting controls disabled |
| Pending refresh could recreate a removed cache/source | Production `SourceOwnership` invalidation and atomic final commit; removal clears selected Dish | Independent deferred real-cache test passed |
| Stale authorization could be accepted after local lock/reopen | Production ownership guard; retired external request blocks overlap until consumed | Source rechecked; shared ownership/grant tests passed; actual Google callback runtime Pending |
| Partial Google permission grant could supply an unusable access token | Production grant policy requires actual Sheets scope and bounded nonblank token | Production grant-policy tests and canonical16 protocol tests passed |
| Clipboard cleanup disappeared with Activity destruction | Process-owned cleanup with separate foreground guard, digest/label comparison and resume reconciliation | Source rechecked; physical acceptance pending |
| Ordinary Ktor requests buffered the entire response before the decoder's cap | Streaming prepared requests bound before EOF | Non-EOF regression passed in bridge16 and standalone29 |
| Compose could keep masked tagged-Dish actions after an edit without observable state change | Observable readiness read by actual Dish panel, cleared by edit | Source reviewed; tagged masked-edit UI regression compiled, not executed |

Root also reviewed callback-exception safety and stale cooking work. Product author
retains ownership of fixes/tests. Inventory load, clear, offline refresh and waiting
Google-grant operations now own busy state; actual conflicting controls are disabled.
Production coordinator regressions pass; prior good caches survive failed reads/writes.
No production source was changed by this reviewer; only the owned hostile test and reports.

## Independent test intent

Tests reject tied/weak column guesses, mapping/header drift, hostile cache origins,
duplicate identities, malformed UTF-8, real atomic-write failure and source-limit
eviction. They verify literal usernames/physical row offsets, stale Dish publication,
clipboard denial/replacement, and production ownership cancellation/remove/switch.
No generated Dish oracle or synthetic authentication is credited as device proof.

## Acceptance boundary

Fresh independent results:shared74, bridge16, app4 and standalone29 tests; zero
failures/errors/skips. Shared/bridge packaging and debug/test/release APKs build.
Lint has0 errors,11 warnings,1 hint. All99 source/build byte/mode paths stayed stable;
51 author-frozen hashes match. 75 protected baseline and128 extension paths remain
unchanged;23 unrelated Cave/skills-lock hashes match. 27 new Kotlin files are<200lines.
[Verification](verification.md) records commands, final APK hashes and proof limits.
Android UI test APK compilation does not imply executed UI tests.
Real Google configuration/account consent/API read, phone biometrics, clipboard
and lifecycle/UX acceptance remain Pending. No emulator/device job was run.
QR receiver/camera, Autofill, Drive discovery and mobile authoring remain later scope.

Unresolved: owner Android OAuth configuration/consent and phone acceptance above.
