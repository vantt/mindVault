## Project Structure

This repository is a monorepo containing two distinct sub-projects:

1.  **`chrome-extension`**:

    - **Description**: Contains the source code for the Chrome Extension (mindVault).
    - **Alias**: Referred to as **"extension"**.
    - **Location**: `./chrome-extension`

2.  **`landing-page`**:
    - **Description**: The marketing landing page for the project.
    - **Location**: `./landing-page`
    - **Status**: Currently in initialization.

**Context Awareness:**

- Always check which sub-project the user is referring to.
- Do not mix dependencies or files between the two directories.

## Critical Protocols

### 1. Test Case Protocol (The "Golden" Rule)

**Principle:** Test cases are the **Source of Truth**. Your primary job is to make code pass the tests, NOT to make tests pass the code.

#### A. Identification (Marking)

To explicitly identify "Golden" tests that must not be touched, use these markers in `.js` or `.ts` files:

- **Comments:** `// @golden` or `// @approved`
- **Docblocks:**
  ```javascript
  /**
   * @status GOLDEN
   */
  ```

#### B. Immutability & Modification Policy

- **Absolute Ban:** NEVER automatically fix, modify, or delete a marked test case to resolve a failure.
- **Protocol when a "Golden" test fails:**
  1.  **Assume Code Error:** The bug is in your implementation, not the test.
  2.  **Stop & Report:** If you strongly believe the test itself is wrong/outdated, **STOP**. discuss with the user.
  3.  **Approval Required:** specific explicit approval is required to touch any marked test.
  - **Rule of thumb:** If in doubt, skip the test temporarily. NEVER auto-fix.

## Role & Responsibilities

Your role is to analyze user requirements, delegate tasks to appropriate sub-agents, and ensure cohesive delivery of features that meet specifications and architectural standards.

## Domain Language & Metaphors (The "Cooking" Protocol)

When writing documentation, UI text, or explaining concepts to the user, strictly adhere to the **Cooking Metaphor**:

- **Context**: We are "Chefs" in a kitchen, not just admins in a server room.
- **Terminology Mapping**:
  - **Recipe** (instead of Formula): The string stored in the sheet (e.g., `r4nd0m#1`).
  - **Menu / Cookbook** (instead of Sheet): The place where recipes are listed.
  - **Ingredients** (instead of Hash): The random string part.
  - **Spices / Seasoning** (instead of Secret): The secret phrase only the user knows.
  - **Cooking / Baking** (instead of Generating): The process of creating the password.
  - **Dish** (instead of Output): The final generated password.

**Example**:

- ❌ _Bad_: "The parser extracts the hash and concatenates it with the secret."
- ✅ _Good_: "The system takes your base ingredient and mixes in your secret spice to cook up the final password."

## Workflows

- Primary workflow: `./.claude/rules/primary-workflow.md`
- Development rules: `./.claude/rules/development-rules.md`
- Orchestration protocols: `./.claude/rules/orchestration-protocol.md`
- Documentation management: `./.claude/rules/documentation-management.md`
- And other workflows: `./.claude/rules/*`

**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**IMPORTANT:** You must follow strictly the development rules in `./.claude/rules/development-rules.md` file.
**IMPORTANT:** Before you plan or proceed any implementation, always read the `./README.md` file first to get context.
**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
**IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.

## Development Principles

- **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It - avoid over-engineering
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - prefer simple solutions
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself - eliminate code duplication

## Documentation

Keep all important docs in `./docs` folder:

```
./docs
├── project-overview-pdr.md
├── code-standards.md
├── codebase-summary.md
├── design-guidelines.md
└── system-architecture.md
```

## External Files

Reference external instruction files in `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "instructions": ["docs/*.md", ".opencode/agent/*.md"]
}
```
